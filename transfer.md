# TRANSFER DATA TO ANOTHER COMPUTER

This is a guide on how to switch data to another computer.

If you need to switch device, for whatever reason, you'll want to know how to take Sayori's memories with you.

To do that, you'll need to know how to do a few things.

## Locate your persistent file.

### WINDOWS

First, make sure you copy the folder that has the mod files in it!

Secondly, you need to copy the folder with Sayori's memories in it.

You can do this by going to Appdata\Roaming\ and looking for the folder called "RenPy"

Copy that folder, and save it to a USB/SSD

See [here](https://i.imgur.com/yZlNmQB.png)

On your other device, go to the same place (Appdata\Roaming), and paste the folder in.

Run the mod, and Sayori should still have all her memories!

### MAC

For Mac users, please follow [this](https://www.macinstruct.com/tutorials/how-to-open-the-library-folder-on-your-mac/) to open the library, and then find the "RenPy" folder.

### LINUX

For Linux users, the RenPy folder can be located at ~/.renpy

### Finishing the Transfer

On your other device, go to the same place you copied the folder from, and paste the RenPy folder in.

Run the mod, and Sayori should still have all her memories!

## BACKING UP THE PERSISTENT

Follow the same steps as above.

Make sure to do this reasonably often, since you'll want an up-to-date Sayori in the event that something happens.

## TRANSFER DATA FROM ANDROID TO PC

First, export your `persistent` with the button in the launcher.

Secondly, pass the zip to your PC. Unzip and you will see the `persistent` file. Copy that in your renpy path of your system with the condition of:\
copying persistent to `renpy/JustSayori/` depending of your system.

Next step, before you enter the game you will need to rename the file `migration.rpyc.bak` located in your game folder, to `migration.rpyc`. 
After opening the game, exit and rename the same file to `migration.rpyc.bak`.

## TRANSFER DATA FROM PC TO ANDROID

You need to make a backup making a zip of your persistent file in your `renpy/JustSayori` path depending of your system. Pass that file to your Android device\
Also download this [file](https://static-trad-club.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/migration.rpyc).

Next, import your `persistent` (the zip that you made in PC) with the button `Import persistent` in the launcher. It will ask for the zip, just browse and select it.

Then, remember the file that you just download? (`migration.rpyc`)\
In the launcher, click on button `Browse internal` files and go to the game folder, click in the button on the bottom right corner, import the file that you downloaded.

Start the game and check if you have your memories, then exit the game and delete the `migration.rpyc` by pressing the file and clicking in the trash button located in the bottom right corner.
